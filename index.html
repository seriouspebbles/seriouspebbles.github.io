 <p class="text" align=center><strong>Check out the 3 bodybuilder-tested techniques that will explode your legs, and the workout that packs them all into one routine!</strong></p>

<p class="text" align=center>Over the past couple of years, I have tried just about every workout technique, rep range, and exercise combo I could think of or read about. Some of these workouts and techniques were spectacular disasters, while others have become staples of my exercise program for all of my body parts.</p>

<p class="text" align=center>Three of my personal favorites are manipulating time under tension, pre-exhaustion, and blood-gorging sets. The real payoff, however, comes from combining all three of these techniques—and five exercises—into one killer workout!</p>

  <h3 class="main-headers" align=center><strong>What's The Difference Between Whey And Casein Protein?</strong></h3>

 <p class="text" align=center><strong>What's The Difference Between Whey And Casein Protein?</strong></p>

<p class="text" align=center>Whey and casein are two of the most popular protein supplements on the market, and for good reason. They're both high-quality, highly bioavailable, complete proteins that are particularly rich in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which makes them great for muscle growth and repair. However, despite both coming from dairy, there are distinct differences between these muscle-building brothers.</p>

<p class="text" align=center>Both whey and casein are milk-based proteins derived from the cheese making process. (As if cheese could get any better, right?) In fact, all dairy products contain a blend of both whey and casein. Milk is roughly 80 percent casein and 20 percent whey.</p>

  <p class="text" align=center><strong> Target your abs from different angles, master the challenge of instability, and build a strong core with this 5-move workout!</strong></p>
  
 <p class="text" align=center>Crunches are great, but for a well-rounded workout, you need to target your abs from different angles. My routine will target your entire range of abdominal muscles with a set of exercises designed to help you flatten your stomach or keep that six-pack!</p>

 <p class="text" align=center>This workout isn't intended to help you build block abs; instead, I've built it to help you keep them lean and strong for athletic activities. I've used a higher rep scheme with relatively short rest periods to do just that. Get ready to sweat and carve your way to a stellar stomach!</p>
